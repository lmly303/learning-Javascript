// Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
/*

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are functions in JavaScript that are executed right after they are defined. 
These functions donâ€™t need to be called explicitly and are often used to avoid polluting the global scope by creating a private scope for variables and code.

    // named IIFE
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED`);
})();

//()() in first () define the function and second () is used to call it
// ; is used to call 2 iife together it basically tells the end of first iife
